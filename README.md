# 002-HW-ProfPort

<!-- Created initial html and css files -->
<!-- Took a look at layout and looked a bit similar to HW-001 so copied over HTML and style.css to have a starting point -->
<!-- Customized header and navigation links; added some style with coloring and addition of banner design -->
<!-- Made a variety of updates with images, place holder texts, headers. Included stylistic highlighting on letters. Adjusted relative positioning of each title to stay on folder image -->
<!-- Made a lot of style changes, added stock images, added column elements to projects. Plenty more to do. -->
<!-- Added and adjusted layout for all placeholder project images, attempting to work on glow effect on hover -->
<!-- Ran out of time to make all necessary changes, the trial and error process was taking much longer than anticipated to properly apply style choices, especially to the work section where I wanted to add proper alignment and hover effects. Will need to revisit some previous lessons to properly implement, maybe starting over from scratch -->
