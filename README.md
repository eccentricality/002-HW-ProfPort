<!-- Took a look at layout and looked a bit similar to HW-001 so copied over HTML and style.css to have a starting point -->
<!-- Customized header and navigation links; added some style with coloring and addition of banner design -->
<!-- Made a variety of updates with images, place holder texts, headers. Included stylistic highlighting on letters. Adjusted relative positioning of each title to stay on folder image -->
